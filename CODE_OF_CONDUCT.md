# Code of Conduct

***

### Web scraping  
Web scrapers are a touchy subject for some. Others have no moral objections at all. For me its all about context.
I built this project for the purpose of being able to solve coding problems at my leisure on my local machine.
I am not always interested in signing up to a website and submitting my code to a solution checker. I just want a reason to code sometimes :)
But understanding that these websites do have their own licence and copyright protections is imporant to remember.
If you are to use this project to scrape problems, Think VERY CAREFULLY about how and where you use those scraped problems.
Most of the websites TOS forbid redistributing their problems and solutions.

### Contributor behaviour
Contributing to this project MUST be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.
  
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:  

The use of sexualized language or imagery  
Personal attacks  
Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments  
Public or private harassment  
Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission  
Other unethical or unprofessional conduct  


If you engage in any of the above behaviour, regardless of how much you have previously contributed in the past, offensive material will be removed, and behaviour will be called out. 
Each incident will be dealt with individually and if necessary you will be blocked from this project.
