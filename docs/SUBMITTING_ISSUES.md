## Feature Requests

To submit a feature request, ensure you use the [feature request template](https://github.com/Pavocracy/leetscraper/issues/new?assignees=Pavocracy&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BREQUEST%5D+%3Ctitle%3E)

Feel free to request anything you would like, or think should be, in leetscraper! However keep in mind this is a small project and very ambitious features will likely
end up in the backlog. In saying that, when you request a feature, if you are an experienced pythonista please do give some code examples or advice on implementation
for the feature, it will help out a lot!
